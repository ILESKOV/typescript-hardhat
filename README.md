# Sample Hardhat Project

This project demonstrates a basic Hardhat use case. It comes with a sample contract, a test for that contract, and a script that deploys that contract.

Try running some of the following tasks:

```shell
    "test": "npx hardhat test test/nft-airdrop/Airdrop.test.ts",
    "coverage": "npx hardhat coverage --testfiles test",
    "compile": "npx hardhat compile",
    "polygon": "npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.ts --network polygon",
    "polygon:airdrop": "npx hardhat run scripts/nft-airdrop/deploy.ts --network polygon"
```
